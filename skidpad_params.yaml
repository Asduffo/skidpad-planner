# check circle estimate
max_fit_error: 0.2 # maximum allowed fitting error of the circle estimates
max_radius: 7.825 # maximum radius of the fitted inner circle that is allowed for a valid skidpad run
min_radius: 7.465 # same like above but lower threshold

# simulation
perception_limit: 25 # excludes all cones outside this virtual perception limit
buggy_perception: 0.2 # simulates random missing cones and removes this percentage of cones
orientation_offset: True # use orientation offset to test robustness yes or not
orientation_offset_angle: 5 # gives the actual orientation offset angle

#
rejection_margin: 1 # margin for cone rejection to exclude bad outliers, margin used to deal with inaccuracies in estimates
circle_discretization: 50 # defines how many circle points should be sampled over quarter circle, so must be multiplied by 4 for full circle
beginning_discretization: 50 # discretization for the beginning line
end_discretization: 100 # discretization for the end line
